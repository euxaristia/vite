# Videre Philosophy

Videre is built on the core UNIX principles of **transparency**, **predictability**, and **cohesive integration**.

## 1. Transparency & Predictability
Unlike modern "IDE-lite" editors like Neovim, Videre avoids "arcane" behavior. There are no hidden background processes, no magic auto-commands, and no complex plugin ecosystems that trigger unexpected UI shifts.
- **No Magic:** If a line is highlighted, you can trace it directly to a few lines of Go code.
- **Predictable UI:** The interface never flickers or moves due to asynchronous tasks.
- **User Control:** Videre only does what you explicitly ask it to do.

## 2. Terminal Cohesion
Videre respects your environment. It is designed to "go with the flow" of your existing terminal setup:
- **Color Settings:** Videre does not override your shell's color scheme or force a proprietary palette. It utilizes standard ANSI codes to ensure a cohesive experience across different terminal emulators and themes.
- **Small Footprint:** By keeping the implementation lean, Videre remains understandable to the user, fulfilling the UNIX goal of a tool that is small enough to be fully mastered.

## 3. Systems-First Design
Written in pure Rust with a focus on efficient data structures, Videre provides a high-performance editing experience without heavy modern abstractions. By leveraging Rust's safety and performance, it achieves a lean footprint (under 3000 LOC) while maintaining high stability.
