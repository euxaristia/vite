.SH ARCHITECTURE
.B vite
implements several key components:
.TP
.B Gap Buffer
Text is stored using a gap buffer—a dynamic array with an efficient gap at the cursor position, enabling O(1) character insertions and deletions.
.TP
.B Mode System
Four distinct modes (Normal, Insert, Visual, Command) control how input is interpreted.
.TP
.B Motion Engine
Dedicated engine for cursor movements supporting word boundaries, line positions, and character searches.
.TP
.B Operator Engine
Handles operator-motion pairs (e.g., d3w) and executes them atomically.
.SH PLATFORM SUPPORT
.TP
Supported:
.IP "• macOS 13+"
.IP "• Linux (any distro with Swift 5.9+)"
.TP
Not Supported:
.IP "• Windows (requires POSIX APIs not available on Windows)"
.SH FEATURES
.TP
.B True Modal Editing
Normal, Insert, Visual, and Command modes with classic vi keybindings and modern enhancements
.TP
.B Efficient Text Storage
Gap buffer data structure for O(1) insertions at cursor
.TP
.B Rich Motion & Operator System
Word motions (w, b, e), character search (f, F, t, T, ;), line motions (0, ^, $, gg, G), and composable commands (dw, 3dd, y$, ct{char})
.TP
.B Neovim-Inspired UI
Faint line numbers, clean status line showing filename/position/scroll indicator, responsive terminal rendering with resize support
.TP
.B Vim-Compatible File Operations
Commands (:w, :e, :q, :wq, :q!), Vim-style error messages, unsaved change protection
.TP
.B Arrow Key Support
Alongside hjkl navigation in all modes
.SH TROUBLESHOOTING
.TP
.B Terminal echo stuck after crash?
Run
.B reset
or
.B stty sane
in your shell. vite restores terminal state on clean exit, but hard kills may leave TTY misconfigured.
.TP
.B Arrow keys not working?
Ensure your terminal emits standard escape sequences. Test with
.B cat -v
then press arrow keys—should see ^[[A/B/C/D
.TP
.B Line numbers not faint?
Your terminal may not support ANSI dim mode. Try a modern terminal: iTerm2, Alacritty, kitty, or GNOME Terminal.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B PATH
vite should be in your PATH for easy access. The Makefile installs to ~/.local/bin by default.
.SH FILES
.TP
.I file
The file being edited. vite creates the file if it doesn't exist when using :w to save.
